Recoding I did of a Practical Computing for Scientsts group project.
Changes:
*Modified shootgun() to accept a boolean dictating which results to return (eliminates shoot_gunB)
*Added shell height plot
*Fixed firing angle analysis to consider both roots (concave down)
*Added v0 hisotgram to scattershot section for clarity
*Fixed target practice analysis to consider both roots (concave down)
*Fixed L, J, N, D for FCTS
*Fixed FCTS loop to ensure it takes in the previous solution state at 10s, not 0s
*Added contour plots to accompany FCTS plots
*Created section headers
*Wrote all new explanations
*Retitled and cleaned up all plots
*Eliminated reused code
*Corrected Units
